"#all-tiles" 

Tiles that are not adjacent to the city can be unlocked, but only if they are connected by a transport network such as roads, trains, boats. Currently, to reaach a disjoint tile section the user must "follow" an asset in that section.

Intended functionality, to be implemented:
  Preserve the unlockability of adjacent tiles
  Allow the camera to move between disjoint tile sections
  Allow the user to see all 81 tiles when selecting new tiles for purchase
